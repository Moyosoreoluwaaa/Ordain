I can do that. Here's a consolidated, well-structured overview of the "Ordain" application, its features, and their complexity ranking.

### **Application Overview**

Ordain is a mobile application developed using Kotlin and Jetpack Compose, following Material 3 Expressive principles. It is built on a four-layer clean architecture to ensure scalability and maintainability. The app aims to help users manage their tasks, track habits, and stay productive.

### **Feature Breakdown and Requirements**

Here are the core features of the Ordain application:

* **Todo List Screen:** A basic task management feature allowing users to add, view, and mark tasks as complete.
* **Journaling:** Enables users to create journal entries.
    * **Templates Grid Screen:** A dedicated screen to select from a variety of journaling templates.
    * **Journaling Screen:** The main screen for writing a journal entry, with a dynamic UI that adapts to the selected template.
* **Pomodoro:** A productivity feature that uses a timer to break down work into focused intervals.
    * **Pomodoro Feature Screen:** The main screen for the timer, with controls for starting, pausing, and stopping sessions.
    * **Pomodoro List Screen:** A screen to view a history of completed Pomodoro sessions.
* **Dashboard:** A central hub that provides an overview of the user's progress.
    * **Streaks LazyRow:** A horizontal scrolling list of pill-shaped components displaying the last 7 days of activity with progress and streak status.
    * **Feature Summaries:** Sections below the streaks row that show a summary of the day's tasks and journal entries.
    * **Filtering:** A UI component with rounded corners to filter the daily summaries.
    * **Navigation:** Arrows to navigate to the full list screens for each feature.
* **Calendar Screen:** A comprehensive calendar view that shows a full month.
    * **Streaks Display:** Integrates the same streak UI from the Dashboard to show daily progress for a full month.
    * **Daily Details View:** A view that dynamically displays the specific journal entries, completed tasks, and Pomodoro sessions for a selected day.

### **Complexity Ranking**

The following is a ranking of the Ordain features from least to most complex, based on the requirements and the development methodology. The complexity is determined by factors such as state management, data aggregation, cross-feature integration, and UI dynamism.

#### **1. Todo List Screen**
This is the **least complex** feature. Its requirements are fundamental and self-contained, involving a simple data model and a straightforward list UI. The logic is limited to basic CRUD operations.

#### **2. Journaling with Templates Grid Screen**
This feature is **low-to-mid complexity**. While the data model for a journal entry is simple, the two-screen flow and the dynamic nature of the journaling screen (which changes based on the chosen template) add a layer of state management complexity that the Todo list lacks.

#### **3. Pomodoro Feature and its List Screen**
This feature is **mid-complexity**. The primary challenge here isn't the UI, but the **time-based business logic** of the timer itself. It requires handling real-time state changes, background processes, and session persistence, which is more intricate than the static data of the Todo or Journaling features.

#### **4. Dashboard Screen**
This feature is **high complexity**. The Dashboard acts as a central aggregator, pulling data from multiple features (Todo, Journaling, Pomodoro) into a single view. The complexity comes from:
* **Cross-Feature Integration:** Coordinating data streams from different parts of the application.
* **Dynamic Filtering:** Managing state for the active filters and updating the UI accordingly.
* **Composite State:** The screen's state is a combination of the streak data, the filtered data, and the navigation logic.

#### **5. Calendar Screen with Streaks Details**
This is the **highest complexity** feature. It's essentially a superset of the Dashboard's functionality but on a larger scale. The complexity stems from:
* **Large-Scale Data Aggregation:** Performing the same complex daily progress calculations as the Dashboard but for an entire month.
* **Ultimate Integration:** It must integrate with every other feature to display not just a summary, but also the **detailed daily activities**.
* **Intricate State Management:** The state must manage the current month, the selected day, and the dynamic details view, making it the most stateful and data-intensive screen in the application.
